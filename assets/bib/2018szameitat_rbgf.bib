abstract = {Inheritance on continental lithosphere is considered as an important aspect on passive margins, since they may control magmatic budget and strain evolution during rifting and lithospheric breakup. On the distal Western Iberian margin, the transition to a steady state oceanic crust was little sampled and less investigated, in comparison to the more proximal parts near to the continental edge. In this work, we use marine magnetic data to analyze some aspects of the transition between the zone of exhumed continental mantle (ZECM) and the unequivocal oceanic crust, using transformed magnetic data. We observe that the end of the ZECM presents some straight magnetic features, especially at the eastern limit of the J anomaly. These magnetic lineaments are consistent with Early Cretaceous flow lines of the Iberian Plate. Straight structures are not expected in a newly formed oceanic lithosphere. Instead, it seems to be controlled by mantle inheritance. These straight magnetic features may indicate basement inheritance controlling magmatic insertions at the beginning of the oceanic crust formation.},
