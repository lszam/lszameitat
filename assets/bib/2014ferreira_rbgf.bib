abstract = {The Aerogeophysical Project Serra do Mar Sul compiled gamma-ray data in the 70"™s, for a large basement area (50,000 km2) in Paraná state, southernBrazil. The cps data were corrected in 1997 by BARMP, Brazil Airborne Radiometric Mapping Project, and are available now as TC (eU), K (%), eTh and eU (in ppm). Thedata for the two large intrusions in the region, the Cunhaporanga Granitic Complex (CGC) and TrË†es CÂ´orregos Granitic Complex (TCGC) were used to generate maps forK, eTh, eU, total counts, and several derived parameters: eTh/K, eU/K, eU/eTh, F. Contrasts between the two complexes are explained as a result of outcrop pattern andweathering (CGC more weathered than TCGC) and differences in overall Th content (eastern TCGC domains richer in the element), but a more uniform U distribution.The differences are enhanced in the eTh/K map (TCGC with lower ratios). The late alaskitic Serra do Carambei intrusion in the CGC shows the highest Th and U values.Gamma-ray patterns in granites subjected to strong subtropical alterations, with heavy seasonal rains, are more difficult to interpret, considering the possibility of strongleaching of K by weathering, and also supergene mobility of U, factors that are absent, or less important, in areas with drier climates. The gamma-ray patterns of thethree elements are influenced by their original distribution in the granites, but can be drastically changed by late hydrothermal alteration and weathering.},
